    <h3>Executive Summary:</h3>
    <p> 
     		My project is Hill Climb Racing Car Game. Targeted audience for my games are both Childs and youngsters. Proposed game is actually the free time hobby. Many of the racing games are available on google play store but most of these are in smooth road. In my purposed game the main component will be a racing car and a driver that drive that car. Some controls will be given on Main Window, by using them player can control the car on the top of mountain. Death matrices for my games are crash of car and empty fuel. Different windows will be offered for player like snow on mountain, rocky hills, mountains having long trees etc. different brands of car will also be offered.

   <h3>Main Character:</h3>
   <p> The main character of this game is man and car. The death matrices of the game are acsedent of car and exhecution of Fuel.</p>
   <h3>Game Play:</h3>
   <p>The object of Hill Climb Racing is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing stages as possible while collecting coins, taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics and using only two simple controls: the Gas and Brake pedals. While in midair, pressing these pedals will instead cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player to control the angle with which they land. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles. Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving avatar's head.

Since its inception, Hill Climb Racing has seen updates that add new content. For example, the garage was introduced in a December 2016 update, where players can purchase cars and tune their parts. Gems were also introduced as a currency of the game.</p>
